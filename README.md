Find isolated ships in the region around a hydrophone using an optimized algorithm and use the audio signal captured by the hydrophone to classify ship vessels.

## INTRODUCTION
ML classification of vessels is an ongoing research challenge for the community due to lack of publicly avaiable ship data[1]. Most of the previous vessel classification works were based on ships images. But there are challenges while using ships images to classify them.

The aim of the project is to release a public datasets of different ships for the underwater acoustic research community and develop a ML model to classify different vessel types trained on the same dataset.
