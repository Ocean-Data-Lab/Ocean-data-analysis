# Ocean-data-analysis
Find isolated ships in the region around a hydrophone using an optimized algorithm and use the audio signal captured by the hydrophone to classify ship vessels.

## INTRODUCTION



The aim of the project is to release a puclic datasets of different ships for the underwater acoustic research community and develop a ML model to classify different vessel types trained on the same dataset.
